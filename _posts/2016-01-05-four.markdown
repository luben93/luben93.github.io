i made a small script and alot of webhooks, so that when i write or update a blog post i tweet and makes a facebook post about it.

#HOW-TO 
1. what i used:
	1. github
	2. codeship
	3. ruby gem twitter
	4. IFTTT
2. how: 
	1. this blog is already hosted on github so no problem
	2. added codeship CI, with html-proofer for testing
	3. wrote a [custom script](https://github.com/luben93/luben93.github.io/blob/master/deploy.rb) for continuous delivery
	4. then i just connected to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/31955078)
